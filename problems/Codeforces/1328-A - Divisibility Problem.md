## Problem statement
A. Divisibility Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive integers aaa and bbb. In one move you can increase aaa by 111 (replace aaa with a+1a+1a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make aaa divisible by bbb. It is possible, that you have to make 000 moves, as aaa is already divisible by bbb. You have to answer ttt independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer ttt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤1041 \le t \le 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then ttt test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains two integers aaa and bbb (1≤a,b≤1091≤a,b≤1091 \le a, b \le 10^9).OutputFor each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make aaa divisible by bbb.ExampleInputCopy5
